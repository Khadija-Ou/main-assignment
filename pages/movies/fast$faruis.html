      "Fast & Furious" is a high-octane action film franchise that
      first hit the big screen in 2001. Directed by Rob Cohen, the

      to a world of illegal street racing, fast cars, and a close-knit
      crew of characters. Led by Dominic Toretto (played by Vin
      Diesel), the crew includes Brian O'Conner (played by Paul
      Walker), Mia Toretto (played by Jordana Brewster), Letty Ortiz
      (played by Michelle Rodriguez), and more.</p>
